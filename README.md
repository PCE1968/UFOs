# UFOs

## Overview
Update Dana's website to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Purpose
The purpose is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Process
First, we need to increase the number of filters available to the user. In addition to the date, weâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

With these additional filters we can now narrow our searches. Here is the table filtering for events in California.

!["filter for california"](static/images/filter_for_california.png)

Then we can also filter further by city, here we chose Fresno.
